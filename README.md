Automated Attendance Tracking Using Face Recognition
Overview
This project implements an AI-powered attendance tracking system that utilizes face recognition technology to automate and streamline attendance management in classrooms. By leveraging Python, OpenCV, and machine learning algorithms, the system accurately identifies and logs student attendance in real-time. The system is designed with a user-friendly interface, seamless MS Excel integration for data storage, and robust security features, making it an efficient and scalable solution for educational institutions.

Key Features
Face Recognition: Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms and OpenCV for accurate, real-time facial recognition and attendance logging.
User Interface: A clean, intuitive interface allowing administrators to manage users, view attendance records, and configure system settings easily.
MS Excel Integration: Attendance data is stored in MS Excel, ensuring simplicity in data management, accessibility, and compatibility with existing systems.
Security: Includes data encryption and role-based access control to protect sensitive information and ensure authorized use.
Scalability: The system is designed to be scalable and customizable, with potential applications in various settings like workplaces, secure entry systems, and more.

Usage
User Registration: Add new users by capturing their facial data through the interface.
Attendance Tracking: The system automatically logs attendance as students enter the classroom, matching their faces with stored data.
Data Management: View, edit, and manage attendance records directly within the application or through the integrated Excel files.
